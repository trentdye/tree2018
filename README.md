# PCB Christmas Tree
A Christmas Tree that lights up with various sequences

## How to Program It
The microcontroller on the board is an ATTiny84A. We used Damellis' Arduino Core for ATTiny84, and used another Arduino, a Pro Mini 3.3V, as an ISP. We followed [this guide from Sparkfun](https://www.sparkfun.com/news/2237) and recommend that you do so as well. Attach alligator clips or solder wires to the pads on the backside of the ornament. You may also solder wires right to the pads. (Note that the presents on the front of the ornament are NOT connected to the programming pads).

DI = MOSI
DO = MISO
